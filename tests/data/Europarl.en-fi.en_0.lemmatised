Resumption of the session
I declare resume the session of the European Parliament adjourn on Friday 17 December 1999 , and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoy a pleasant festive period .
although , as you will have see , the dread ' millennium bug ' fail to materialise , still the people in a number of country suffer a series of natural disaster that truly be dreadful .
you have request a debate on this subject in the course of the next few day , during this part - session .
in the meantime , I should like to observe a minute ' s silence , as a number of member have request , on behalf of all the victim concern , particularly those of the terrible storm , in the various country of the European Union .
please rise , then , for this minute ' s silence .
( the House rise and observe a minute ' s silence )
Madam President , on a point of order .
you will be aware from the press and television that there have be a number of bomb explosion and killing in Sri Lanka .
one of the people assassinate very recently in Sri Lanka be Mr Kumar Ponnambalam , who have visit the European Parliament just a few month ago .
would it be appropriate for you , Madam President , to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President express Parliament 's regret at his and the other violent death in Sri Lanka and urge she to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ?
yes , Mr Evans , I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggest would be entirely appropriate .
if the House agree , I shall do as Mr Evans have suggest .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I would like your advice about rule 143 concern inadmissibility .
my question relate to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again .
the Cunha report on multiannual guidance programme come before Parliament on Thursday and contain a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalty should be introduce for country which fail to meet their fleet reduction target annually .
it say that this should be do despite the principle of relative stability .
I believe that the principle of relative stability be a fundamental legal principle of the common fishery policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible .
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what be merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that be something I can competently do on Thursday .
that be precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .
Madam President , coincide with this year ' s first part - session of the European Parliament , a date have be set , unfortunately for next Thursday , in Texas in America , for the execution of a young 34 year - old man who have be sentence to death . we shall call he Mr Hicks .
at the request of a French Member , Mr Zimeray , a petition have already be present , which many people sign , include myself . however , I would ask you , in accordance with the line which be now constantly follow by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community , to make representation , use the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent , to the President and to the Governor of Texas , Mr Bush , who have the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemn person .
this be all in accordance with the principle that we have always uphold .
thank you , Mr Segni , I shall do so gladly .
indeed , it be quite in keep with the position this House have always adopt .
Madam President , I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament have consistently show an interest .
it be the case of Alexander Nikitin .
all of we here be pleased that the court have acquit he and make it clear that in Russia , too , access to environmental information be a constitutional right .
now , however , he be to go before the court once more because the public prosecutor be appeal .
we know , and we have state as much in very many resolution indeed , include specifically during the last plenary part - session of last year , that this be not solely a legal case and that it be wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accuse of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiary of his finding .
these finding form the basis of the european programme to protect the Barents Sea , and that be why I would ask you to examine a draft letter set out the most important fact and to make Parliament 's position , as express in the resolution which it have adopt , clear as far as Russia be concern .
yes , Mrs Schroedter , I shall be pleased to look into the fact of this case when I have receive your letter .
Madam President , I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have keep your word and that , during this first part - session of the new year , the number of television channel in our office have indeed increase considerably .
but , Madam President , my personal request have not be meet .
although there be now two finnish channel and one portuguese one , there be still no dutch channel , which be what I have request because dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we be send to this place of exile every month .
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a dutch channel as well .
Mrs Plooij - van Gorsel , I can tell you that this matter be on the agenda for the quaestor ' meeting on Wednesday .
it will , I hope , be examine in a positive light .
Madam President , can you tell I why this Parliament do not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually pass ?
why have no air quality test be do on this particular building since we be elect ?
why have there be no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998 ?
why have there be no fire drill , either in the Brussels Parliament building or the Strasbourg Parliament building ?
why be there no fire instruction ?
why have the staircase not be improve since my accident ?
why be no - smoke area not enforce ?
it seem absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .
Mrs Lynne , you be quite right and I shall check whether this have actually not be do .
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors , and I be certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulation we ourselves vote on .
Madam President , Mrs Díez González and I have table question on certain opinion of the Vice - President , Mrs de Palacio , which appear in a spanish newspaper .
the competent service have not include they in the agenda on the ground that they have be answer in a previous part - session .
I would ask that they reconsider , since this be not the case .
the question answer previously refer to Mrs de Palacio ' s intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comment which appear in the ABC newspaper on 18 November .
Mr Berenguer Fuster , we shall check all this .
I admit that , at present , the matter seem to be somewhat confused .
we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything be as it should be .
Madam President , I should like to know if there will be a clear message go out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today 's decision refuse to renew the arm embargo on Indonesia , consider that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorse the arm embargo in Indonesia in the past ?
today 's decision not to renew the embargo be extremely dangerous consider the situation there .
so Parliament should send a message , since that be the wish of the vast majority .
it be irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo .
as people have say , the situation there be extremely volatile .
there be , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .
we do not know what be happen .
so why should eu arm producer profit at the expense of innocent people ?
in any event , this question be not presently include among the request for topical and urgent debate on Thursday .
agenda
the next item be the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as draw up by the Conference of president at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the rule of Procedure .
no amendment have be propose relate to Monday and Tuesday .
relate to Wednesday :
the Group of the Party of European Socialists request that a Commission statement be include on its strategic objective for the next five year and on the administrative reform of the Commission .
I would like Mr Barón Crespo , who make the request , to speak to propose it . that is , if he so wish , of course .
then we shall follow the usual procedure , hear one speaker in favour and one against .
Madam President , the presentation of the Prodi Commission ' s political programme for the whole legislature be initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of european Socialists which be unanimously approve by the Conference of president in September and which be also explicitly accept by President Prodi , who reiterate his commitment in his inaugural speech .
this commitment be important because the Commission be a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and , therefore , basically dictate this Parliament ' s political and legislative activity for the next five year .
I would also like to point out , Madam President , that this Parliament vote to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature . it do so again during this legislature , in July , and then , in September , it vote once more to approve the whole Commission .
there have therefore be enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for we to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizen .
to this end , I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September , which recommend that the proposal be present as soon as possible .
the event of last week - which originate outside the Conference of Presidents , that conference be use simply to corroborate and ratify decision take elsewhere - present we with a dilemma . either the Commission be not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it .
accord to its President , it be in a position to do so .
give that the Commission be represent by Vice - President de Palacio , I believe that , before voting , it would help if the Commission could let we know how ready it be to present this programme , as agree . alternatively , Parliament be not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be suggest .
in my opinion , this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament , as well as introduce an original thesis , an unknown method which consist of make political group aware , in writing , of a speech concern the Commission ' s programme a week early - and not a day early , as have be agree - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discuss in February , so we could forego the debate , since on the next day our citizen will hear about it in the press and on the internet and Parliament will no long have to worry about it .
my Group believe that since a parliament be mean to listen , debate and reflect , there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that , if the Commission be ready to do so , we still have time to re - establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfil our duty to our fellow citizen .
therefore , the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , and which you have mention , be that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday , include its propose administrative reform , because , otherwise , we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation : on the pretext that there be no text , on the one hand , the President of the Commission would be deny his right to speak in this Parliament and , on the other hand , there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament have no prior knowledge of the text on which it be base .
therefore , Madam President , I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote .
( applause from the PSE Group )
Madam President , I really be quite astonished at Mr Barón Crespo ' s behaviour and the fact that he be now ask for this item to be put on Wednesday 's agenda .
Mr Barón Crespo , you be unable to attend the Conference of president last Thursday .
I be not criticise this ; it happen from time to time that people send someone to represent they .
Mr Hänsch represent you on this occasion .
in the Conference of president , we have an in - depth discussion .
your Group be alone in advocate what you be say now .
we then put it to a vote .
as you know , each chairman have the same number of vote as his Group have member .
there be a vote on this matter .
as I recall , the outcome of this vote be 422 vote to 180 with a few abstention .
this mean that all the Groups with the exception of the non - attached member - but , of course , they be not a Group - be in agreement ; only your Group think that we should proceed as you have propose here .
all of the other be of a different opinion .
that be the decision .
I should now like to comment on the issue itself .
we have confidence in the Commission and in Romano Prodi and , after a difficult procedure , as everyone know , the vast majority of our Group support the vote of confidence in Romano Prodi and the Commission .
we believe , however , that the Commission 's strategic plan need to be debate within a proper procedural framework , not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the European Parliament , but also on the basis of a document which be adopt in the Commission and which describe this programme over the five - year period .
there be no such document !
the Commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in February .
we have say , very well , if the Commission do not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as January then we will do it in February .
we have agree to this .
after all , we do not wish to quarrel with the Commission ; if at all possible , we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to tread the same path .
however , we in Parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with everything which come out of the Commission .
I should like we to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five - year programme in our group .
you can not prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content .
that be why we would recommend - and it be my impression that the Commission be also open to this idea - that we hold the debate on the Commission 's long - term programme up to the year 2005 in February - and I hope that the Commission will agree on a programme before then which it will propose to we - and that , at the same time , in February we also hold the debate on the Commission 's legislative programme for the year 2000 .
the fact that the subject be connect also suggest that we should hold the debate on both programme together .
that be why my Group firmly reject the proposal make by the Socialist Group .
( applause from the PPE - DE Group )
Madam President , I would like to make it very clear that , above all , the Commission have absolute respect for the decision of this Parliament and , amongst those , the decision establish its agenda .
we therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide .
but I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi make a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate , as Mr Barón Crespo have remind we , which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission ' s legislative programme , on the broad area of action for the next five year , that be to say , for this legislature .
Madam President , I would like to say that the agreement reach in September distinguish this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission ' s legislative programme .
I would also like to say that the Commission be prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it be convenient and that we be ready to do so this week as we have agree originally , on the basis that it would be present the day before in a speech to parliamentary group .
therefore , Madam President , I would like to repeat that the Commission have debate the action plan for the next five year and , when Parliament decide , - this week if that be the decision - we be prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five year and , next month , the programme for 2000 , which be what we fully agree upon .
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objective should be reinstate .
( Parliament reject the request ) President .
still on the subject of Wednesday ' s sitting , I have another proposal regard the oral question on capital tax .
the PPE - DE Group be request that this item be take off the agenda .
be there a member who wish to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this ?
Madam President , I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists . I be tell that large section of the Socialist Group be also keen to have this item take off the agenda , because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote be receive from the work group of member of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter .
I do not know whether this information be correct , but the PPE - DE Group would , in any case , be grateful if this item be remove because Parliament have address this issue several time already .
decision have also be adopt against a tax of this kind .
that be why my Group move that this item be take off the agenda .
thank you , Mr Poettering .
we shall now hear Mr Wurtz speak against this request .
Madam President , I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering ' s lack of logic .
he have just be preach to the Group of the Party of european Socialists because they go back on a decision take in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of president , and now he be do just the same .
we discuss that matter and we be unanimous , with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups .
as my fellow chairman will recall , I even mention that it be not a matter of know whether one be for or against the Tobin tax , but of whether one dare to hear what the Commission and the Council think of it .
it be not a lot to ask .
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retain so that we can find out , once and for all , the position of these two body regard the proposal which be relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion , particularly after the tide of feeling generate by the failure of the Seattle Conference .
we shall proceed to vote on the PPE - DE Group ' s request that the oral question regard the capital tax be withdraw from the agenda .
( Parliament reject the request , with 164 vote for , 166 vote against and 7 abstention )
Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertise this debate .
thank you very much .
Madam President , have my vote be count ? I be unable to vote electronically , since I do not have a card .
my vote be " in favour " .
indeed , if we add the two member who have declare themselves , then the result of the vote would be ....
Madam President , the Presidency have already declare the result of the vote .
there be no room for amendment .
Madam President , in the early vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicate that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group .
that do not happen .
I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allow to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group .
this be an important matter .
it would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just do in the light of their own political analysis .
Madam President , I do not wish to reopen the debate , but I have also ask for the floor , to comment on Mr Barón Crespo 's motion .
you do not call I either .
I regret this , but the vote have already be take and the decision be make so let we leave the matter there .
I be terribly sorry , Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox . I do not see you ask to speak .
even so , I think the position be quite clear and they shall be enter in the Minutes .
when we adopt the Minutes for today ' s sit tomorrow , then any member who think the position have not be explain clearly enough may ask for amendment .
this seem to I to be a workable solution .
of course , the Minutes for tomorrow ' s sitting will take into account any additional explanation .
I think this be a well solution than proceed now to extremely time - consume explanation of vote .
Mr Cox , Mr Hänsch , would this be acceptable to you ?
Madam President , if the vote record correctly how my Group vote I shall not , and can not , object to that .
if your ruling be that I can not give an explanation of vote , I accept that but with reservation .
we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes , as we always do , of course .
if they do not properly reflect the position adopt , then we may correct they , if necessary .
( the order of business be adopt thus amend )
safety adviser for the transport of dangerous good
the next item be the report ( A5 - 0105/1999 ) by Mr Koch , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the common position adopt by the Council with a view to adopt a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirement for safety adviser for the transport of dangerous good by road , rail or inland waterway ( C5 - 0208/1999 - 1998/0106(cod ) ) .
Commissioner , Madam President , lady and gentleman , I can be quite frank in say that I welcome the Council 's common position on harmonise the training of safety adviser for the transport of dangerous good by road , rail or inland waterway .
firstly , we need to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirement of Directive 96/35 / EC , which oblige the Member States to appoint safety adviser and to organise the training , instruction and examination of these people but do not explain this explicitly .
secondly , by adopt this directive we achieve a ) an increase in safety when dangerous good be both transport and tranship ; b ) a reduction in distortion of competition result from wide variation in national training structure and training cost and c ) equal opportunity for safety adviser on the european labour market .
thirdly , this directive , as it currently stand in the common position , guarantee - in particular because it confine itself exclusively to minimum standard - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union ; by adopt it we contribute to the Member States ' bear a high level of individual responsibility .
all of this be in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and be therefore to be greatly welcome .
our amendment from the first reading have , I believe , be take into account very satisfactorily .
they have either be accept or transpose with no change in the substance , or they have be reject because the corresponding european arrangement have not be include , for example a system of penalty for violation of the rule or a complex classification structure for related group of question .
the one unanimously adopt amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport , which concern the timetable for implement the directive , be something which I would urge you to support .
by not set a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead give they a period of three month after its entry into force , we be introduce a flexibility clause which ensure that the directive will be implement without delay .
I would urge you to endorse this .
Madam President , we can not and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accident cause major damage on our road , but also on our railway and waterway , not solely but at least partly because those involve do not take the transport of dangerous good seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the driver or other responsible for the various vehicle - a minor accident have all too often become a major disaster .
as an austrian , I still have a vivid memory , as , I believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human life last year in the Tauern Tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the part of the tunnel which have be destroy in this fire continue for many month at huge expense .
the renovation project , which last for month , cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe .
the traffic which have to be divert because of this stretch the patience of many thousand of people in the EU to the limit .
in fact , all hell break loose in some municipality in my province .
Prevention have to be our answer to disaster of this kind and this draft directive be an important step towards well - train safety adviser be available , so that the right action be take in good time .
all the same , we must not content ourselves with enact european law to ensure great safety .
we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rule be transpose by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they be also apply afterwards .
please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement .
I should like to address one final point . we must not content ourselves with seal another hole in the safety net and shut our eye to the fact that , where transport safety in Europe be concern , there be still much more to be do .
in this context , I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible , who be with we here today , to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continue to make it safe for traffic to transit tunnel in the future , so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disaster on this scale .
Madam President , first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which have , at its heart , the issue of transport safety .
the report look at the issue of harmonise the examination requirement for safety advisor work in the area of transportation of dangerous good by road , rail and inland waterway .
I congratulate he on his excellent report .
transport safety have sadly be in the news recently : the Paddington rail crash in London , the terrible rail crash in Norway , the two aviation crash involve EU citizen and the natural disaster involve the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four month - remind we that transport safety can never be take for grant and that those charge with protect the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified .
the rapporteur have point out to the House that in its common position the Council have accept six of Parliament 's ten amendment put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament 's other amendment have be retain .
my Group will therefore support the common position and look forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide we with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible .
when it come to safety my Group will always support any initiative to improve transport safety .
we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent event have prove .
Madam President , I would like to make a few comment .
I would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the Commission for the proposal it have submit .
we be concern here with the harmonisation of examination requirement but also , in fact , with minimum requirement .
this be a pity , in a sense .
needless to say , safety on road , railway and inland waterway be of key importance and , give the international nature of these type of transport , training for safety advisor should also be harmonise , therefore , as well as the requirement of the new ADR , for example , which be under way .
this be important , but so be enforcement and there be , of course , a number of reason why we need to pay particular attention to this .
just think of the road accident which have occur over recent year , for example in Belgium , the Netherlands and a number of other country where lorry carry dangerous good continue to drive in foggy condition when really they should have pull off the road instead .
or ship from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ship over here , with all the obvious risk that this entail .
furthermore , it have transpire that research in the port in Belgium , Finland , but also in Japan have show that 50 % of container with partially dangerous cargo be not deliver correctly for shipment .
in short , the issue be an important one .
if we look at the situation where safety adviser be concern , in a number of country it be compulsory to employ such safety adviser in company as from 1 January of this year .
there will be major problem with enforce this rule at present , especially with small company , as these can not afford safety advisor .
these small company either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which cause problem .
it be therefore also be request that ISO 9002 certificate possibly include the fine detail of these activity in the form of annual report and company analysis .
the work be do . all that remain be the business of enforcement .
I would like to mention one final point .
with regard to enforcement , proper agreement must also be conclude with the eastern european country because they will not enter into treaty which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001 , that be to say in eighteen month ' time .
this give they a competitive edge for the interim period .
this be not in itself anything dreadful , but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspect for good transport by road , rail and inland waterway and incorporate these , as part of the acquis communautaire , as soon as possible and present they to the accede state .
Madam President , the importance of transport safety be highlight on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so .
the ever increase volume of good pass through Europe entail all kind of risk , know and unknown , for employee and the social environment .
those have to deal with these risk should therefore meet stringent requirement .
the relevant standard which have be lay down in another directive , 95/35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous good .
I be very pleased that agreement have also be reach with the Council on minimum standard regard examination , although I would have prefer it if uniform , set standard and module have be establish , so that certificate would be of equal value internationally .
this , however , do not seem feasible .
finally , the amendment table by the rapporteur be perfectly logical and I can , therefore , give it my wholehearte support .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his report which , though technical , be nonetheless of very great significance for safety .
I should like to make just a few comment .
firstly , I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I be convince that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention be pay to the issue of safety , be it on the road , on the waterway or at sea .
consider that it be only today that we be deal with a Commission proposal first make on 19 March 1998 , even though Parliament respond relatively quickly , this time lag be a little too long .
this be not just the fault of the Commission , but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .
my second point have already be mention : it concern the minimum standard .
in principle , I believe that in many case where transport be concern we should be work towards increase flexibility and country - specific rule .
however , when it come to safety , I be rather sceptical because safety in Sweden , for example , be in principle no different from safety in Germany , Italy or Austria .
I can live with these minimum standard , but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully .
should flexibility of this kind result in there be inadequate rule in some country then we should work towards great harmonisation .
my third point have also be mention already .
as you know , like Mr Rack , I come from a transit country , where this issue play a particularly important role .
we do not want to make the condition of competition bad for some country unilaterally and improve they for country such as Austria or other transit country .
but I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous good to a minimum , in all country , whether they be transit country or not .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Koch , on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improve the text and present this report and this proposal ; in the end there be only one amendment on the requirement for the aptitude examination for safety adviser in the transport of dangerous good by road , rail or inland waterway .
we understand that it be important that the two institution - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy , and in particular the transport group , be magnificent .
the common position include practically all of the amendment accept by the Commission and harmonise the minimum examination requirement for safety adviser and , at second reading , we can accept the amendment on the propose date , which be much more realistic than the one originally suggest by the Commission , bear in mind that we have now spend several year debate this question .
very briefly , I would like to thank the various member for their intervention and to tell you that safety be one of the Commission ' s priority in the field of transport .
as Mr Simpson have say very correctly , this be a process which we can never take for grant or regard as having come to an end .
the process of increase safety margin and safety guarantee in transport be a process which must be improve day by day .
in this regard , I would also like to refer very briefly to the problem of the tunnel , which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have refer to , which , in the case of Austria , be doubtless a very sensitive issue , and great effort should be make to improve their safety .
in one of the bad accident to have occur recently , the good be transport be not dangerous in themselves .
Margarine and a few kilo of paint which , in principle , do not present risk , lead to a genuine disaster .
therefore , we will have to see how the requirement guarantee the maximum degree of safety can be far improve .
finally , I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all type of transport .
this week we will be hold a debate here on the safety of sea transport , in light of the Erika disaster , and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objective in term of the safety of air transport .
but I would like to say that safety be a priority objective for the Commission .
as I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster , we do not wait until there be a disaster to deal with the question of safety , but we work on it even when there be no such circumstance , which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem .
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speaker and especially to the rapporteur , Mr Koch .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
transport of dangerous good by road
the next item be the report ( A5 - 0104/1999 ) by Mr Koch , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amend Directive 94/55 / EC on the approximation of the law of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous good by road [ com(1999 ) 158 - C5 - 0004/1999 - 1999/0083(cod ) ] .
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , the directive on the approximation of the law of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous good by road , which enter into force on 1 January 1997 , contain a number of transitional provision which be only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity be link to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN , that be the European Committee for Standardisation .
delay in the CEN ' s work be now make it difficult to apply this very directive .
in particular , annexe can not be adapt to take account of technical and industrial development .
I regret this since we be have to take action because other have not do their job .
in this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55 / EC which have be table for discussion today .
should the European Union fail to take action , then Member States would be oblige to amend their national legislation for a very brief period , until the CEN complete its work , which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty .
the amendment to the directive on today 's agenda do not therefore affect the exist harmonisation of the transport of dangerous good in the Community .
it merely prolong transitional rule by postpone deadline , delete provision which be no long applicable , and lay down the procedure for a ) carry out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous good and b ) enact less stringent national regulation , in particular for the transport of very small amount of dangerous good within strictly define local area .
the amendment to the directive be consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the Member States obtain more power .
the Commission decide whether the Member States may impose certain rule of their own .
in so do , it be support by a committee of expert on the transport of dangerous good under the regulatory procedure .
the procedure for the exercise of these implement power confer on the Commission be lay down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999 .
the proposal to be discuss today , to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous good by road , date from May 1999 , however , and could not therefore take account of the late comitology procedure .
two of the amendment table and adopt unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amend comitology procedure .
we would like to ensure that there be a reference to this as early as the recital and that the period within which the Council have to make a decision - which be not clearly word - be set at a maximum of three month .
in addition , the need for great transparency have be point out .
a further amendment allow the Member States to impose more stringent requirement , in particular for vacuum tank , if work be do or good be transport as a priority in temperature well below -20ºC.
this be in the special interest of northern european region .
a final amendment be intend to ensure that tank and tanker put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be use provide that they have be construct and maintain in accordance with it .
I do realise that this be only a small step towards increase transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report .
Mr President , colleague , a happy new year and millennium to you all .
I be speak for the first time in this plenary part - session , so this be quite exciting for I , a little like first love , although that do last long than two minute .
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission ' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous good by road .
it be good that this directive should be establish now , as , otherwise , Member States would have to amend their national act for a very short time , a period of transition , which would again mean unnecessary cost and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy .
the Commission ' s proposal , however , do not take account of all the fact , such as the cold climate that prevail in the northern region .
consequently , I have table some amendment to Mr Koch ' s intrinsically excellent report , which have be adopt by our committee .
my amendment concern the frost - resistance rating for tanker carry these dangerous good .
accord to the Commission ' s proposal -20ºC would have be sufficient .
on the shore of the Mediterranean , it be hard to imagine that in lapland temperature can fall considerably low than that .
there be support for the EU in Lapland also , so let we remember they .
I have thus propose that the frost rating be lower to -40ºc.
this would be necessary to keep safety standard at the level they be in northern region previously .
I hope my proposal will be take into consideration in tomorrow ' s vote .
Mr President , with your permission I should like to begin by express my admiration for the way in which you execute the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate .
I think that it be quite superb .
on the subject at hand , I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the good - however dangerous they be - which be transport on Europe 's road , railway , and so on be as safe as possible .
this directive be a contribution to this .
what we be do today be essentially a nuisance .
the rapporteur , Mr Koch , to whom we express our thank for the work which he have do on this , have already point out that basically everything could have be somewhat more advanced have it not be for the inactivity on the part of the CEN , which have be very dilatory in draw up and adapt the directive .
that be why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that , in 2001 , we will finally have Community regulation for the transport of dangerous good by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our road be a good deal safe .
Mr President , the report we be discuss here do not , in itself , entail any major change .
Most of the propose amendment be of a purely technical nature .
it be nonetheless worth emphasise that , each time we make this type of decision , it be good from a broad environmental perspective and it be beneficial because it create well prior condition for exploit the possibility of the internal market .
very large quantity of dangerous good be transport around the EU , both on road and railway and by sea .
this make it necessary to have proper rule govern transport of this kind .
in area after area , we be now obtain common minimum regulation for the Member States .
this be extraordinarily positive , and there be cause to thank the rapporteur , Mr Koch , for the work he have put in on this issue .
this be also important where the prerequisite for the internal market be concern .
if we be to get a common transport market genuinely up and run , it be important that we should not only have regulation but that these regulation should also , as far as possible , apply to every country .
I should like to conclude by comment on a third matter which be also of significance , namely an amendment table by Member of Parliament , Mr Ari Vatanen .
in many way , the prerequisite differ from one Member State to another .
by approve this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern part of the European Union .
this make it necessary to also take account of the way in which material and packaging be affect by cold of this kind .
it be good that , in establish the present regulation , we can also be flexible .
I hope that the Commission be able to accept the present amendment .
Mr President , I would like to thank not only Mr Koch , but also the Vice - President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declare their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledge it as a priority .
the reason Mr Koch produce his sound report be because the work in the cen and within the United Nations Economic Commission be proceed none too expeditiously .
I would like to ask the Vice - President if she be in a position to tell we today what the state of play be with regard to the effort towards harmonisation be make by these two organisation , and whether the EU be in a position to hasten these harmonisation effort , in accordance with principle that be as simple as possible .
for one thing be clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union , traffic do not stop at our border , it go beyond they .
hence there be certainly every reason to introduce more far - reach regional provision .
if the Commissioner be unable to do so today then would she be prepare to inform the committee in writing of how matter stand and what stage negotiation between the CEN and the Economic Commission be at ?
Mr President , I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplement the debate which we hold in October on rail transport .
we all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation ( CEN ) have not be able , in the required time , to carry out the amendment of the provision necessary for the require harmonisation within the European Union .
this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow we to incorporate differentiate element which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours .
a moment ago , Mr Vatanen speak to we of low temperature , not of 20 degree below zero , but of 40 degree below zero .
of course , we accept that amendment - it be absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstance which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union , which sometimes take the form of specific and of concrete requirement for the establishment of standard and characterisation of a technical nature .
I would like to say , with regard to Mr Swoboda ' s comment on the activity of the CEN , that we be urge they to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if , despite the new deadline , we be to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulty because their work have not be conclude .
lastly , Mr President , the basic problem justify this amendment of the directive have be point out . we have refer to the delay by the CEN , the amendment of certain provision , the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexe and the need to for it to be more specific .
the Commission accept all of the contribution of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , Mr Koch , which be contain in the various amendment , specifically four .
we therefore accept the four amendment which have be propose .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination
the next item be the report ( A5 - 0108/1999 ) by Mrs Schroedter , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund : guideline for programme in the period 2000 - 2006 [ COM(1999)344 - C5 - 0122/1999 - 1999/2127(cos ) ] .
Mr President , it be particularly pleasing for I to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what be regard as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament , namely Wales .
a major part of Wales , as you know , have be grant objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme .
it be quite clear that many people within Wales be look to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulty that we undoubtedly face .
we have see poverty grow in Wales ; and grow still far since 1997 .
we have see the gap between rich and poor widen .
we be look , therefore , within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wide improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality .
what be , however , deeply damage for we be the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance be something that have be , in a sense , a success of the government .
it be sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulty that Wales face .
that be why I want to highlight some of the issue that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront .
we look to the Commission to deal with point in relation to additionality .
we be dissatisfied with the fact that those figure seem to have be in some way hide within UK figure .
we look to the Commission also to ensure that there be match funding for project .
we look to it to challenge the UK Government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be provide the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure , be involve in the planning stage .
finally , we ask that the Commission ensure that Structural Fund monie be spend in a way which be transparent .
too much of what take place within this Parliament be not transparent .
this be one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales .
Mr President , our committee view these issue very differently and , to start , I will speak from the point of view of research .
we see it as a very positive sign that , in her own conclusion , the rapporteur have take account of our committee ' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund country should broaden the research infrastructure by locate university and college in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped region well than now and make it easy for educated people to remain in their home district .
this will be possible with action on the part of government , and such decentralisation of high education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development .
another matter we would like to address , specifically from the point of view of industrial policy , be that we would have like the Commission to pay more attention to the effect of service , electronic commerce and the grow use of the internet , when they be plan the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds .
poverty and wealth use to depend more on mean of livelihood .
the rich area be those where there be job in industry , but today those area might have become a burden , and they may well be poor , mean we also have to invest in new sector of industry such as electronic production , as I might call it , and the production of service , because they be the industry of the future .
in my opinion the committee draft the report have not take sufficient account of this , so on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I would draw the Commission ' s attention to this issue .
finally , as the committee represent energy , we would have like the issue of support for renewable energy resource from Cohesion and Regional Development fund to have be emphasise still more , thus , through a process of coordination , increase the use of renewable so that the scant funding resource in the energy programme might have be compensate by mean of these more substantial sum .
Mr President , I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she have do on this and to explain to colleague that I be speak for my colleague , Mrs Flautre , who follow this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who be unfortunately ill .
I would like to draw people 's attention to amendment Nos 1 and 2 which be agree by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accept by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
these amendment deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local scheme to develop employment opportunity and strengthen social cohesion .
in the past , this Parliament have view the social economy as an important potential provider of employment .
these amendment also fit in with this Parliament 's view that social exclusion be a serious issue need constructive action .
we hope that those consider rejection of these amendment have very powerful reason to offer to both Parliament and their citizen who be seek employment .
in her report , Mrs Flautre also draw attention to an area where coordination be sorely lack , yet desperately need .
the Commission proposal refer to the four pillar of employment strategy and the five field of action of the European Social Fund .
but the lack of specific guideline here be particularly to be regret , as the idea of link Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000 - 2006 programme .
it could be say that the omission give the impression that the Commission too have no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance , which be subject to review after three and a half year , and the Member States ' annual national plan for employment .
we hope that the Commission can reassure we that this be an oversight which be now be deal with constructively .
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal present by the Commission , in accordance with its mandate , be a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
I would like to point out , however , that this starting point indicate to we the challenge which face we : maintain a population in rural area , give the change take place in all type of economic activity owe to agriculture ' s increase lack of importance amongst the various source of income for rural society .
this , as well as the deficiency in the network of infrastructure and service and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore be seasonal and lack diversity , exacerbate the exodus from rural area .
the consequence do not inspire hope .
it be the young people who be disappear , who be get an education and find work outside of the rural area , all of which have an unfavourable effect on those area .
this lack of infrastructure be also an obstacle to the establishment of company and the creation of job .
we have to remember that rural area represent almost four fifth of the territory of the European Union .
agriculture only provide 5.5 % of employment in the Union .
furthermore , three quarter of our farm worker be part - time and require supplement to their income .
for this reason , one of the most important and essential objective which we should set in the European Union be to make effort to create new job in rural area , outside of the agricultural sector , in sector such as rural tourism , sport , culture , heritage conservation , the conversion of business , new technology , service , etc .
however , even though the role of agriculture be not exclusive , it be still essential , not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost town , but also because farmer play a fundamental role in manage the land , in preserve biodiversity and in protect the environment .
therefore , we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which be consistent with the objective we have set . we want rural area , at the dawn of the 21st century , to be competitive and multi - functional , both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non - agricultural activity .
it be important to prioritise general criterion for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issue , which have be only partly take up by the Committee on Transport , Regional Policy and Tourism in its point 16 and 17 .
in conclusion , I would ask the Commission to take these five point into account when establish the conclusion on the four pillar because I believe that , for the European Union , maintain the population in rural area must be one of the priority objective .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thank Mrs Schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work . I think that this work have be carry out extremely well .
I would also like to thank she for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political group when compromise formula have need to be reach in the face of this avalanche of amendment - and perhaps there be more of they than we expect - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we be now discuss .
we feel that it be important that the Commission take account of the conclusion adopt by this Parliament , at least in spirit , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we be do here be a useless exercise , and nothing but hot air .
the truth of the matter though be that we believe - and this be also show in the way the conclusion have be draft - that the Commission must take account of what be adopt by this Parliament , particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directive .
in our amendment , we have state the importance of the necessary synergy be produce between the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and Community initiative , so that their application should be reflect , in the good and most profitable way , by the gradual elimination of disparity between region and by the creation of job which be , when all be say and do , the two central purpose of the fund we be discuss .
in order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attain these objective , we think that those who generate employment , the real entrepreneur and those who really guarantee new source of employment , that is , businesspeople , must participate in this initiative .
small and medium - sized business , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these fund .
if they do not , if businesspeople feel marginalise , if entrepreneur can not take part , not only in manage but also in receive these fund , we will have miss an opportunity to attain our objective more rapidly .
also , in order to attain our objective , to overcome the disparity between region and to seek out source of employment , it be crucial to give our complete support to new technology , to transport and communication network and to renewable energy .
all of this must be do - I repeat - with the participation of private business , which , by unite its effort with those of public administration , but complement they , never obstruct or exclude they , will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of job .
Mr President , it be incumbent upon I to remind my colleague , Mr Evans , of why Wales actually achieve objective 1 status .
it be because of the discredit policy of his own Conservative Party .
let I also remind he that when his party leader , Mr Hague , be Secretary of State for Wales , he break every rule in the book on additionality which lead to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf - mathie regard regulatory requirement .
I can tell you that the british Government be aware of its regulatory requirement on objective 1 additionality .
I suggest Mr Evans go back and read the regulation .
my Group have make extensive amendment to both report up for debate today .
I want to focus our mind on the essential role of the guideline .
the objective be to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration , to get the most effective use of resource in the wide partnership and to put these region back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life - support machine .
it be important to identify the skill and potential of our region in the hi - tech sector .
it be particularly important in the light of report in the medium that Europe be rapidly lose ground to the US in the hi - tech growth industry of the future .
the operation of the previous round of programme be also very instructive in tell we what guideline should not be about .
they should not be about create additional layer of bureaucracy and red tape .
they should not be about shift priority and policy halfway through project development , result in inevitable delay and underspend , particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement .
the implementation and operation of the guideline can not be leave to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service .
there must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate , while respect the specific local and regional aspect of Commission programme .
the conclusion be that we must make the case for guideline to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme manager and fund - user and to get the maximum potential out of our new field of regeneration .
if we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak region we will eventually get they back onto the road of attract substantial investor confidence , which will be the key to future success .
this be how we be go to judge the success of these guideline : whether EU regional policy with a good , solid , enable guideline , can open up new opportunity and allow our poor and structurally weak region to play their full part in contribute to the growth and prosperity of the EU .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report . she have go into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she take account of many of the amendment that have be table regard this report .
the rapporteur have also quite rightly state that Parliament be not hear in time regard the guideline .
we be badly behind now in this matter .
hopefully , the stand Parliament have take will help , however , in the mid - term appraisal of the programme and in their practical implementation .
for the time , the report grow too large when it be be debate .
it contain detail and issue that have already be raise in previous report .
at this stage it be more important to concentrate on assess how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy , bear in mind that the aim be to reduce regional inequality .
our Group emphasise the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of Member States and the role of local player in draft and implement programme .
it be especially important to get sme involve in the planning and implementation of programme .
our Group also consider it important to take great account of remote and peripheral area and wish to increase interaction between town and rural area .
we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercise and we be call for a reduction in the bureaucracy that have take root in the drafting and implementation of programme .
project implement with support from the Union have have their effect water down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative process .
fund have often be grant for project which have have no lasting benefit for the area concern .
project have to be carry out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be make more productive .
while the report be be prepare , it be interesting to discuss the Union ' s regional policy in general .
for we new member , it be the first time , and this be a very interesting process .
this report be very good and our Group support it .
Mr President , Commissioner , as proof that this Parliament have not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group , Elisabeth Schroedter , have not be able to reach plenary sitting because the plan for regional development for the period 2000 - 2006 for objective 1 region have be sit in the Commission ' s office for several month .
bear this in mind , this House should , in any event , demand that , before the Community support framework for the period in question be approve , they be study and submit for debate in this Parliament , specifically in light of the guideline that we have present today .
this be because we think that they be particularly able to create employment in the poor and least - develop region and we would thus contribute to reverse the harmful trend towards inequality that exist in european society and to the move towards a fair Europe .
Mr President , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination be to achieve economic and social cohesion .
we be oblige to participate in draft directive and also in assess their result .
we be oblige to do so because we be the representative of the citizen in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions .
we feel that the Funds be a necessary but insufficient condition for achieve economic and social cohesion .
we might be mistake in use the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator .
some speaker have already mention unemployment and the fall in population .
we will have to study several indicator , which will enable we to see the current state of regional society that be in a bad situation than other , and how they be evolve .
it be clear from some of the report that have be present to Parliament ' s plenary sit today that Europe ' s 25 most prosperous region enjoy a level of unemployment which be five time low than in the 25 least prosperous region .
this fact mean that the European Parliament , the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically .
I agree that the European Parliament do not have the opportunity - or that it be not give the opportunity , as we have reach the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directive .
I do not think , however , that this report have come too late .
we need to consider it together , so that the new objective 1 programme and the plan for regional development , which have be draft before the directive come into force , can be submit for revision and proper assessment .
we all agree that we should ask that , halfway through these programme , when the assessment of the directive be make , Parliament should be give an equally influential role on the ground that we be the citizen ' representative .
our citizen can not accept that the European Union take decision in a way that be , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic .
they need to see the political dimension work , to see that official accept their responsibility and that there be communication with the citizen .
this be what we be today ask the Commissioner for .
I would like to think that , give his previous experience as a regional President , he will agree to propose indicator , and a strategy , which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity .
Mr President , I support the main proposal of the report concern the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000 - 2006 and the main recommendation of the report which include the following : there must always be an integrate approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds .
this mean that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authority and national government with regard to how these fund be to be spend .
Member state be urge to attach great importance to integrated strategy for revitalise relation between town and rural area .
this latter point be of particular importance .
while urban renewal in our city be very important we must always strike a balance in our policy between promote rural development and improve the life of city dweller .
we do not want to build a Europe of city alone .
the Structural Funds have play a key role in the development both of urban and rural part of peripheral country , mainly through the upgrading of road , water treatment and related transport network .
this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guideline lay down by the EU leader at their Berlin Summit last year , which be support by Parliament at its last May plenary part - session .
Key EU programme between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly help to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral country and objective 1 region within Europe .
the key now be to consolidate and make permanent the progress make to date .
this would ensure that the peripheral country and the ultraperipheral region , the poor region in Europe , be in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone , as well as within an ever - expand internal market where the free movement of good , person , service and capital exist .
in conclusion , while key infrastructure project have be support by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund , we should remember that the European Social Fund have play a very important role in help the less well - off in our society .
the Social Fund have certainly improve our third - level institution , finance our post - leave certificate programme and put in place comprehensive scheme to help combat youth and long - term unemployment , assist early school leaver and promote high standard of adult literacy .
Mr President , on numerous occasion in the past I have disagree with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issue . this time , however , I actually agree with she .
whether or not this will encourage she to continue along the same path , I can not say . nevertheless , I would like to commend she on her work .
the second point I would like to make be that we would have prefer it if the guideline have be add to the regulation in the form of an annex , as we and Mrs McCarthy , as rapporteur for the general regulation , have ask .
unfortunately , this do not happen . Mr Bernié be not to blame for this as it be a matter for the previous committee .
I be raise the issue just to reiterate Parliament ' s position .
thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guideline provide they do not deviate from the comment we have make so far .
they be particularly beneficial to the Member States , and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission have place on the issue of sustainable development , job creation and , more particularly , on equal opportunity and transport issue .
personally , I at least be totally in favour of the guideline .
as an islander , however , I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development .
this be not the first time that this issue have not be give the consideration it deserve . this have be an ongoing concern for the five year that I have be a Member of this Parliament , and I have raise the issue time and time again .
Commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , as Article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the Treaty of Amsterdam provide for an integrated policy for island .
therefore , the Commission should address the issue once and for all .
the time have come to implement the programme , and so Member States should also assume their responsibility and do their job properly .
as for we in Parliament , I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which be sign in May .
I be absolutely certain that this code will be observe and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the development and detail concern the implementation of the programme .
Mr President , Commissioner , in this minute and a half I should like , first of all , to congratulate Mrs Schroedter .
I know many have already do so , but she have indeed earn our praise for be particularly open and attentive to proposal from all side , and I think it be this openness which have give her report the quality we see today .
I share the regret she express , namely that Parliament have become involve rather late in the day as regard these guideline , since by now the procedure for negotiation with the state be so far advanced that I can not see this report have any sort of immediate effect , which in my view be a pity .
consequently , I feel we must look to the future and establish guideline for the mid - term review in 2003 , and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003 .
in brief , I would like to say that we be enter the period when we be call upon to manage the programming for 2000 - 2006 , which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenge to face .
the first be the harmonisation of national development policy and regional development policy .
subsidy be not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public service be lack .
we must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that Union policy interface with the subsidiary national policy for regional development ?
the second challenge be that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical term .
these be two area of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask he to involve we .
finally , in this time of natural disaster , I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds .
as you know , it be up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation .
Europe should not be completely absent , as the state tend to want .
public opinion and the press nowadays accuse we of be unavailable to give a response , even though we be go to be fund a large proportion of the national operation .
I think we should be capable of say this loud and clear .
I also think we should ensure , or ask Member States to ensure , that there be some publicity give to european aid whenever it be use to repair damage cause by natural disaster or accident .
Mr President , the priority give to financial and monetary criterion reinforce the increase in inequality of every shape and form .
as far as french planning expert be concern , for example , the most probable scenario today be that of the entrenchment of regional disparity within each country .
well , the Structural Funds have help to apply a brake to this process .
our project of a Europe that aim to satisfy social need envisage the convergence of living condition towards the high common denominator .
its implementation would certainly require extend the scope of redistribution instrument such as the Structural Funds .
what we be propose specifically be a unify capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the fund use to support the harmonisation of social protection system and the reduction of work hour at european level .
the Commission , however , though bind to issue guideline , do so only reluctantly and in a vague manner .
the report put forward today re - establish its place in the political sphere .
it be one of the step towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .
this be what persuade we to vote in favour of it .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
over the come year , face with the challenge of globalisation and eastward enlargement , Europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy .
to this end , Europe as a whole , and each Member State individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resource and capacity , include the Structural Funds .
for this to be possible , what we need from the European Commission be not just good intention , but clear guideline and a firm commitment to monitor the way these resource be use by the Member States .
for example , in recent year Italy have have problem in utilise the Structural Funds , mainly because of excessive bureaucracy , insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operator at local level .
firstly , we need to make the well possible use of consultation as a means of ensure proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operator in decision - making , precisely so that imbalance and inequality can be avoid . secondly , a genuine effort be require to make administrative procedure simple and more transparent , since , they be all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated , to the point of hinder access to the Funds .
I will conclude , Mr President , by say that the failure of the Commission ' s communication to focus on territorial pact and , especially , method of combat unemployment among woman and young people , be cause for serious concern .
Mr President , like my colleague Mr Evans , it be a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue , especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom , the West Midlands , which have hitherto benefit from objective 2 funding in particular .
but the report before the House tonight be a prime example of how , if we be not very careful , we can produce very grandiose - sound idea that lack the substance to make they relevant to the people who benefit directly from they .
the report itself be well - intentione but , as so often when we deal with these issue , lack clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability .
that be why I and my Group be propose three key amendment and addition to the text , not to take anything away from the proposal , but to make it more relevant to those whom it be there to guide .
I would like to explain our thinking here .
firstly , we be concern with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds .
past experience dictate that , as the elect representative of the European taxpayer , we should , and indeed must , demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money , hence our amendment and addition relate to achieve what be know as " value for money " indicator in the grant - give process .
next , we all too often see vast sum of money be spend on project whose outcome will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period .
but at the mid - way point or end of that period there be no effective way of terminate the project if it have not prove successful .
our addition therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategy so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing cost which be often load onto the taxpayer , but we also avoid the well - rehearse syndrome of throw good money after bad .
finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the fund be disburse .
there should be great involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation .
also the type of project fund need to be shift away from small - scale revenue - base project , which be hard to monitor , towards capital scheme where , in the majority of case , the benefit be there for all to see .
that way the much - trumpet need for transparency in the use of these fund and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the long term on the local tax base in area where such project be locate will be diminish and the European Parliament will show how seriously it take the need for such reform .
if these change to the report be support by the House today , I believe that they will move we forward in the next phase of achieve the historic objective which the fund be set up to bring about , namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprive area of the European Union which need to be bring up to a decent standard of living , not by give a hand - out but by give a " hand - up " .
I urge the House to support these change .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which be a meticulous and substantive piece of work .
the European Union ' s structural and cohesion policy be , without doubt , essential tool for create the right condition with a view to tackle and reduce the level of economic and social disparity between the region .
despite the step take thus far , these level be still very high , and be unacceptably high as regard unemployment .
these policy objective can only be achieve through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well think - out and sensible guideline .
let we not forget that when these policy be effective , they also benefit european citizen by directly improve their quality of life .
let we not forget either that great consideration should be give to the island and remote region of the European Union because their geographical location be a hindrance to their economic and social development , unless of course the Commission be intend to build bridge or underwater tunnel link they to the european mainland .
in closing , I would like to point out that the structural policy as a whole require great flexibility so that they can adapt to change circumstance and thereby respond to the new challenge and opportunity of the new millennium , for which we all hope for the good .
Mr President , Mrs Schroedter ' s report undoubtedly contain several important observation , and I would like to congratulate she on that .
however , I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community ' s regional policy .
quite briefly , structural policy do not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it aggravate it .
the agricultural economy and agricultural region have be irreparably damage by the exist regional policy , which have have dramatic consequence on employment level in rural area and on the living condition of farmer , particularly in the South .
regional disparity be become much more marked within the Member States .
if we examine the datum present in the sixth periodic report , we will see that the last decade have witness a proliferation of regional disparity .
little consideration , if any at all , have be give to the great problem face the island region of the Union whose shortcoming as regard infrastrucutre structure , transport , communication and energy have result in their gradual depopulation .
the Union ' s economic and social policy be just as much to blame for that as its regional policy .
a large section of the Union ' s population have strongly condemn this policy for be dangerous and anti grass - root .
unfortunately , the new guideline seem to be head in the same direction and there be no sign that thing will change once they have be implement .
Mr President , I would like to say a few word in order to highlight two point make in these report which be of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union .
the first be the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .
we be concerned to hear news that the Commission be take this objective less seriously .
we still feel that economic and social cohesion be one of the Union ' s fundamental objective .
secondly , I agree with what have already be say on the issue of the island and I would also like to bring the outermost region to your attention .
in future , we would like to see great ambition apply to the subject of the outermost region such as , in my country , the island of the Azores and Madeira .
I would like to ask if the Commission be able to enlighten we on the reason for the delay in the Commission ' s report on the outermost region , which have be long await by Parliament ?
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for be willing to include in the report the suggestion we make .
Mr President , Commissioner , the guideline be intend to help steer the Member States towards achieve the reform objective contain in the programme .
however , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the Commission ' s proposal in this respect be reminiscent to a far great extent of a catalogue of possible measure within the scope of the various policy area .
nonetheless , their true purpose be to give direction and to set priority .
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contain too little in the way of recommendation to the Member States on simplify administration , and I support the call for negotiation to concentrate on promote a favourable climate for labour - intensive , small and medium - sized enterprise , on set clear objective for alternative source of financing include provision for risk capital and private financing , and on start - up help for company include new information technology and investment in innovative field .
I be particularly in favour of a propose amendment table by my Group to paragraph 10 , to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the project .
I should be very grateful , Mrs Schroedter , if you would actually include this propose amendment in the part relate to subsidiarity in your positive deliberation .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we uphold unanimously the criterion that it be of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the intervention of the Structural and Cohesion fund which be work for a well opportunity for job for the unemployed and for equality between man and woman .
unfortunately , the excellent Schroedter report do not take account of this criterion , despite the fact that there be considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how , in fact , these fund be provide splendid assistance to the most backward region in order to bridge the gulf that separate they from Europe ' s most highly - develop region .
they be grow , but only in term of GDP .
they be increase in competitiveness but they be not all experience an increase in wealth because there be no increase in employment and there be still difference in employment opportunity between region .
Commissioner , please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority , because this be our citizen ' great problem .
please take account , in strategic term , in the revision and in the allocation of reserve , of employment need , because this , fundamentally be what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require .
Mr President , it be important that the guideline head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programme of the crucial seven - year period 2000 - 2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation , particularly for woman and young people , and ensure a balance be strike between economic and social policy and regional policy .
it be particularly important to address those serious issue concern urban area , employment in rural area , aid to agricultural region and equal development opportunity for the island of the European Union and for the greek island which , of course , comprise half of the island of the Union , as stipulate in Article 158 of the Treaty .
cohesion policy need to be strengthen far because a Europe which totally disregard the standard of live in its region can neither be reliable or viable .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , I would like to express my great interest in listen carefully to the comment , occasional criticism and suggestion that some of you have just make in your speech with reference to Mrs Schroedter ' s report .
everyone understand , Mrs Schroedter , lady and gentleman , the reason and the time limit involve - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limit or delay , since we be discuss this report right now , as the representative for the Commission , I consider that the report have be issue at an opportune moment with regard to the guideline for 2000 - 2006 as it be now that we be start the new regional programming .
Mrs Schroedter , you quite rightly point out that while it be chiefly up to the Member States and the region to define their own priority in development matter , European Union cofinancing of the programme require , and be the justification for , a situation where community prioritie as debate and approve in this House should also be take into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully point out .
so , lady and gentleman , I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guideline before mention the principal comment and criticism that you , Mrs Schroedter , and the various member of this House , have make .
regard the role and structure of these guideline , Mr Hatzidakis , Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mention that the purpose of these guideline be to assist national and regional authority in prepare their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1 , 2 and 3 as well as their link with the Cohesion Funds .
this mean put forward the Commission ' s priority , base on past experience in implement the programme , as well as current Community policy relate to structural operation .
the objective be that these priority should contribute to the well use , to the optimum and efficient use , as some of you have wish , of Community involvement , include , Mr Bradbourn , use , if necessary , the performance reserve which be specifically intend to encourage the optimum and efficient use of european public monie .
when I speak of optimum utilisation , I be refer both to the national and regional level .
and so , Mr Seppänen , I shall also mention at this point , speak of the national level , the link with the Cohesion Fund .
this be the purpose of these guideline .
regard their content , as you know , lady and gentleman of this House , they be focus on three strategic priority that your rapporteur point out very clearly but , at the same time , very passionately , as I understand her presentation just now .
the first priority be to improve the competitiveness of regional economy in order to create , in all sector , but especially in the private sector , as Mr Berend say , the maximum number of serious , worthwhile and permanent job , the competitiveness of regional economy , all regional economy , and in particular , Mr Evans , that of Wales , but not only of Wales .
and , because there be a number of you who have just point out what appear to you to be an omission , let I also add the regional economy of the european region handicap by their distance from the centre , be they remote region , island region or , of course , the most remote region which be , naturally , the most distant .
perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro , who ask I about this , that , as I write to the president of each of these most remote region , the Commission do indeed request an extension of several week before publish its anticipated report .
concern the most remote region , it be only quite belatedly that we receive the memorandum from the various government , but this be not necessarily an excuse , just an explanation .
we must therefore take these memorandum into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .
I myself take part in a meeting of the most remote region on 23 November and , within the College , we consider that we would need several more week before be able to produce a report that deal appropriately with the extremely serious problem and live up to the expectation of these most remote region . I would thank you for your understanding in this matter .
so that be the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economy .
the second priority , which several of you have stress , Mr Puerta in particular , but there be other , not that I be mention they in any order of priority , be the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment , particularly by raise the profile of human resource far more so than in the past .
lady and gentleman , we now have a European Union where the disparity between country be observe to be less great , prove the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund , but where , at the same time , in relation to unemployment - as you write , Mrs Schroedter - an increase gap exist between the 15 or 20 rich region and the 15 or 20 poor or most disadvantaged region .
this be a situation which be , as it should be , unjustifiable and intolerable .
as far as I be concern - take into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this be a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention , as far as possible , with your support , of dedicate all the appropriation for which I be responsible to this improve social , human and territorial cohesion , particularly in order to prevent what I once call in this House a two - speed Europe , a Europe of wealthy district but , at the same time , a Europe of impoverished area .
the third objective be urban and rural development , within the scope of a balanced territorial policy . in fact , the guideline take two horizontal principle into account .
the first be rural development , and let I say , Mrs Schroedter , that I be include in rural development the matter of sustainable transport , an issue I have be involve in personally for a long time . I particularly remember the time when I be Minister for the Environment in my own country .
the second principle be that of equal opportunity , particularly for man and woman , as well as the european strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union .
finally , and in order to respond to the concern which you have express in this House , particularly yourself , Mrs Schroedter , in these guideline we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategy , for development or redevelopment , which , of all the priority , offer the maximum opportunity to synergy , to the measure undertake and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership .
you express some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership , yet there be a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guideline .
however , I do wish to mention - since you have ask I to do so - that , as far as I be concern , this partnership - and I spend long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - be a tool , one use to involve local brainpower , be it in the public sector , in the form of elect representative , the social and educational sector , association , or in the private sector ; a decentralised partnership , and let I mention in this connection , in response to Mrs Angelilli , the territorial pact , which be one of the mean available to this decentralise partnership .
these be the reason why the guideline be present accord to thematic priority , since they must be take into consideration , under each of the objective , to different extent in accordance with the specific situation of each of the Member States and region .
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comment you have make , lady and gentleman , and firstly on procedure .
it be true that consultation with Parliament have only come about at a late date .
let I remind you that when the guideline be adopt by the Commission , in the form of a draft in February 1999 , in line with a new procedure intend to make it easy to present comment on this text , my predecessor , Mrs Wulf - Mathies , present they to Parliament immediately .
due to the election to the European Parliament take place around this time , however , Parliament be not able to undertake its examination of these guideline until after the text have be definitively adopt , in July 1999 .
here in this Chamber , lady and gentleman , among you , I wish to assure you that in the negotiation for the programme which be only just begin - Mr Hatzidakis ask I a question about this - as far as Member States be concern , your observation will certainly be take into consideration .
and let I assure you , furthermore , that when the Commission adopt the guideline with what we call the mid - term review in mind , in line with the regulation , then the point of view of this House , as express in this report , will also be take into account .
now to the form . on the subject of the role of the guideline , Mrs Schroedter , you point out that this be the context in which guideline on a number of european objective , often very precise one , should be provide .
I shall not list they all , but they include implement intersectoral policy , increase efficiency in the use of public fund , assist the various partner in draw up regional or national programming together , etc .
the Commission take note of these , but several of these guideline or these question be relate more to other document , such as the Guide to the reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document .
draw to a close , I should like to focus on a number of challenge which you reiterate , Mrs Schroedter .
I be think , for example , of the idea that these guideline be not specific enough in their recommendation .
this claim that your report make must be see in the context of last spring ' s negotiation .
the Commission keep to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulation , which stipulate that the aim of these guideline be to provide Member States with broad , indicative guideline on relevant and agree community policy .
I actually quote the text itself , in quotation mark .
moreover , the guideline may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessment which must be the tool use to specify priority and the effectiveness of these programme .
you then mention , Mrs Schroedter , the section of the guideline relate to urban and rural development , point out that urban development be not sufficiently take into consideration .
I find the opposite the case .
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attach , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .
indeed , I have occasion recently to say as much to all the minister responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere .
as regard rural development , which a number of you bring up , particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez , the guideline be in line with the twofold objective mention by your rapporteur : a strong agricultural sector link with increase competitiveness in rural area , but also protection of the environment and Europe ' s rural heritage .
it must , however , be stress that the guideline under discussion be relate only to the Structural Funds , whose objective 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority .
and indeed , on the subject of the balance of rural society , let we not forget that there be also the new rural development policy cofinance by the EAGGF Guarantee Section , aim at promote reform in european agriculture and support the multifunctional aspect of agriculture .
at this stage , I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrate into the programming for Objective 2 rural area , in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section be for objective 1 region .
in any event , I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter .
before concluding , I should like to tell Mr Savary that we be go to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequence of the storm which have strike France , Austria and Germany , in particular , in the last few week , and at the same time we shall once again be discuss , together with my fellow Commissioner , Mrs de Palacio , what lesson we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which have also affect the coast of France .
I shall therefore reserve the right , if you permit , sir , to give you my own opinion , which , to a great extent , match your own recommendation regard what action we might take to combat the oil spillage use objective 2 .
I shall remind you that the Commission be go to be approve the objective 2 zone plan for France , Sweden , Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow .
we shall then have an appropriate tool for work , particularly in the majority of the region affect by the storm .
indeed , this be my reason for pay a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the french department which have be severely disable by the storm .
in conclusion , with thank for your understanding , Mr President , I should like to thank you , Mrs Schroedter , for the quality of your work and that of the committee , and to tell you that I be very pleased , apart from a few difference in our assessment of the role of the guideline . we have discuss this and I have attempt to clarify my point of view .
I be very pleased with the level of support offer by your House to the Commission in establish these guideline , which have be submit to the Member States for information when establish their own programme .
this can only reinforce the concept base on a number of element of good practice draw from our experience of the current 1994 - 1999 programme . I feel this augur well for effective cooperation between our two institution , at this time when program for the period 2000 - 2006 be be undertake , good joint working practice , which be , Mr Hatzidakis , back up by something I be very attentive to : observance of the code of conduct which link our two institution .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
social and economic situation and development of the region of the Union
the next item be the debate on the report ( A5 - 0107/1999 ) by Mr Berend , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the region of the European Union [ SEC(99)0066 - C5 - 0120/99 - 1999/2123(cos ) ] .
Mr President , Commissioner , this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the region of the European Union constitute a milestone in the analysis of regional datum and highlight the progress make in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report .
I consider , however , that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development level in Europe offer a somewhat over - simplify view of the situation and , unfortunately , this be often the message take up in the press and in some speech .
the Commission report generally relativise this observation , particularly when it refer to the social and economic situation of some region of the Union in which I have a special interest , by which I mean the french overseas department and , more generally , the most remote region .
in this respect , I be pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism have adopt one of my amendment call on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote region and , more specifically , to consideration of the impact of the measure shortly to be adopt under new Article 299(2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
finally , in my view , this sixth periodic report present interesting argument from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe , particularly when it outline the importance of relation between the central area of Europe and its more remote region .
even if the Commission be still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion , its periodic report demonstrate the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union ' s structural policy and within the scope of the approach initiate by the SEC .
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agree with the report that Mr Berend have just present and congratulate the author , both on the quality of his conclusion and on his flexibility , which ensure that the different group be able to incorporate amendment in committee .
it must be remember that , currently , the European Union ' s overall competitiveness be , in general term , 81 % of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive unit , that be the region , also improve . furthermore , this be at a time when technological development , economic globalisation and our problem , which be enlargement and the single currency , demand that the region , as well as business and individual , make more of an effort to be competitive .
the European Commission ' s sixth report present very valuable conclusion .
I shall summarise two of those highlight by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .
the first be that important advance have be make in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have be a major , although not decisive , factor in reduce regional inequality .
the negative conclusion be that the great effort make have be more efficient in harmonise the european region ' gdp and productivity than in harmonise its level of unemployment .
it be therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation .
this , Commissioner , be the first commandment for the come period .
thus , Mr President , I ask my fellow member to approve this report and I ask the Commission , as other speaker have do , to take good note of the conclusion of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000 - 2006 .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having take due account of the propose amendment while the committee be debate it .
the sixth periodical report give a basis for assess the implementation of the Union ' s regional policy aim .
the report show that growth have be uneven , despite all our effort .
very rapid growth be continue in Central Europe .
the strong regional centre also continue to grow fast than the general european average , whereas many southern european and northern area be develop considerably more slowly .
we now require an in - depth analysis of why regional policy be not produce the desire result in all area .
be the reason bureaucracy or be it because insufficient notice have be take of interregional difference , long distance , climate that be too cold or too hot , sparse population and austere condition ?
how can the Union respond to the challenge of global development in a way that the less developed area can remain a part of that development ?
it be also important to discover what the effect of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union ' s more remote area .
the Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility .
some Member state have be in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional fund when regional aid come via the Union have be increase .
this have chip away at the result that regional policy have produce .
in the future , we must also develop indicator so that measure can be target at the right time at the right place .
for example , uncontrolled migration have not be give sufficient consideration .
in this connection , too , weight have to be give to the decisive importance of sme as employer and force behind regional development .
it be absolutely essential that company in area develop more slowly adopt the late technology and know - how .
our Group be in favour of adopt this report .
Mr President , Commissioner , the European Union ' s regional policy have , until now , not be able to interpret , in any significant way , the exist difference in our inhabitant ' income .
we have a serious situation in which in the European Union today , there be a genuine link between unemployment and poverty , as demonstrate by the very worrying fact that unemployment have reach , on average , 23.7 % in the region worst affect , region which also happen to be poor area , whilst in the 25 region with the low unemployment , correspond to the rich area , unemployment stand at just 4 % .
give this situation , the report approve by Parliament must highlight the need for measure that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment : measure such as the appropriate use of structural fund for these purpose , which be often misspent , with centralised state policy and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication system , with the particular aim of integrate the least develop region into the Trans - european rail network , which be due in 2007 .
there should also be measure that respect and develop the resource and capability of these country ' agriculture and fishery , which be often harm by the European Union ' s own insensitive policy , as well as the promotion of active policy to create job , particularly for woman and young people . only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality , which be not the historical product of inherent defect but of marginalisation and economic policy which have have harmful effect .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Berend ' s report be precisely in line with the strategy determine by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increase competitiveness be bring right to the fore .
the overarch objective of the structural fund such as job creation , boost equality of opportunity , increase the sustainability of employment and development , be only mention in pass .
this attitude appear to I to be unjustified . I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be place on these point in the seventh periodic report .
this do not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness , particularly as I myself be an entrepreneur in an objective 1 Region , that be in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany , and be only too aware of the problem and concern of small and medium - sized enterprise .
it be absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measure be introduce in the objective 1 Regions , that be to say job creation measure , special programme for support employment opportunity for woman and initiative to help people set up their own business .
they be support by appropriate European Union structural fund activity .
support only the competitiveness of company will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development , simply because there be no basis for a self - support upturn in these objective 1 Regions .
after all , the knowledge that economic development alone do not help to combat unemployment substantiate the fact than an increase of at least 3 % in gross domestic product be need to create any additional job at all .
concentrate to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand - orientate economic policy be not the answer .
and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a less extent , in rationalisation .
it be imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand - orientate economic policy if we be to have any chance at all of improve the social situation in these area .
the situation vary to an enormous degree throughout the region .
in other word , what be need be a number of accompany measure if anything at all be to be accomplish there .
for example , these would be measure for vocational training , for further education , for re - integrate people who have already be exclude from the production process , for the flexibilisation of work time and working time arrangement , in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspect and perhaps also to promote employment opportunity for woman again .
Mr President , my compliment to the rapporteur for his in - depth report .
the key goal of the structural fund be to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the region within the European Union .
by stimulate a diversity of investment , the European Union be endeavour to increase the gdp per capita and to boost employment .
from the sixth periodic report on the region , one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentive do not always have the desire effect .
the effort make in order to drive up the gdp per capita in Objective 1 region do not always result in such an increase , not really a satisfying result over a period during which , certainly over the past couple of year , there have be economic growth .
as indicate by the rapporteur , the effect of the structural measure , on the other hand , be minimal as far as employment be concern .
some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid be therefore call for .
also , the observation that the disparity between region within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raise serious question .
Mr President , it therefore seem worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authority , especially in connection with boost employment .
it be , after all , they who have most knowledge about the region which fall under their remit .
by allow they to develop tailor - make plan for the relevant region and , if necessary , tie this in with financial aid , a high return can be achieve .
surely this must be the ultimate goal .
I be therefore in favour of the Commission delegate the practical detail and implementation of measure to the Member States and region .
follow on from this , it be probably also more meaningful , with regard to the financial aid to region , to give Member States more say anyway .
by shift the criterion from the region to the Member States , we can avoid a great deal of problem later on .
finally , I would like to draw attention to the position of the central and eastern european country .
the report show that , in general , they be a long way behind EU country , especially in term of gdp per capita .
with the plan accession of a large number of these country in the foreseeable future , it be a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy .
I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of other and call on the Commission to submit proposal for reform soon rather than later .
Mr President , Commissioner , follow close scrutiny of this report one can not escape the conclusion that it be possible to fulfil the state objective of the structural policy only in part .
for example , whilst the disparity between the region have increase rather than decrease , there have be a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect .
equally , unemployment level in the bad affect region barely fall at all , indeed they rise in some case .
I wonder why it be that the structural fund be not employ more efficiently .
even the accumulation of money from the cohesion fund and the structural fund have fail to have the desire effect in all region and country .
since it be the declare aim of all politician throughout Europe to reduce unemployment , then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employ be the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the region by appropriate measure such as increase support for research and development , improvement in infrastructure and raise the level of training .
genuine structural reform and a competition - friendly taxation policy be the cornerstone of a successful economic base .
if we do not wish to stand accuse of pursue a cost - intensive structural policy that do nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measure draw up so far must be analyse .
we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union have be a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of job and when there be a significant reduction in the unemployment rate .
Mr President , Commissioner , my thank go to the rapporteur for handle this very important report , because development in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizen of Europe will judge that we have be successful in our work .
this issue , which have an impact on their everyday life , be a key issue as regard EU credibility .
it have to be concede that the EU have already aid , I would say quite magnificently , the development of poor country .
I remember what Portugal and Greece use to be like when I drive through those country for the first time twenty - five year ago .
in this connection , french speaker would speak of a " coup de chapeau " : in other word , I take my hat off to the EU .
the EU really deserve such a gesture , but difference between rich and poor area within country be still too great .
what be the result ?
People react by vote with their foot and go where they can earn a crust .
consequently , we have to build school , hospital , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many time over .
this be very costly and it also cause very great social problem .
Most people , however , would like to live in the area in which they be bear and raise , if they be give the chance to , in other word , if there be work there .
we must give they this opportunity .
this be a moral obligation the EU and all of we have .
the solution , as I see it , lie in clearly encourage entrepreneurship .
by entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business , but create will .
I mean the attitude where a person want to get on in life , whether he or she be an employee , the owner of a business or an official .
what be a fair society ?
one in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easy for his or her child .
in this way , positive development of the region be also possible , because people will start business and will work if they be give the chance .
finally , I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America , where hard work be still in fashion and success be an indication of ability and not the object of envy , as it often be here in Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , as my time be limited , I shall get straight to the point .
firstly , let I make a statement of fact : the fruit of growth be not distribute equitably within the Union .
the most remote region , still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rate , offer one example of this .
in Reunion , for example , the rate be 37 % .
this be not a situation relate to the economic climate , however ; rather it be a structural problem , create by our remoteness , our insularity , in short , our own specific personality .
the principle of specific , exceptional treatment be envisage in Article 299(2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such case .
it only remain to put this principle into practice .
the Commission document expect to be ready in December 1999 be delay until January , then February , and the initial thinking do not fill I with much optimism .
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission .
as regard taxation , state aid , the Structural Funds and defend our traditional product , practical measure characterise by dare and ambition must be plan as a matter of urgency .
if these do not materialise , then , unfortunately , convergence and cohesion will remain no more than word for we , and it be to be fear that the structural policy undertake in our region , despite the size of the amount commit , will end in failure .
Mr President , as all the previous speaker have do , I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate he on the quality of his report .
just like the previous report , this extremely competent and precise analysis , the recommendation it support and your own comment , lady and gentleman , shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we be involve with the programming of appropriation for 2000 - 2006 .
I should also like to make a few comment , firstly , Mr Berend , regard the assessment you have make of this sixth periodic report .
you point out the quality of the report and you even write , if I be not mistaken , that it mark a real improvement in comparison with previous report .
on behalf of all the official of the Commission and my predecessor , Mrs Wulf - Mathies , I must inform you that we be very alert to the evaluation make by this House and by yourself .
the Commission be certainly very anxious to ensure , Mr Berend , that this sixth periodic report should show that progress have be make and a threshold cross in term of the quality of the analysis submit to you .
I be think in particular of the content of chapter 2.1 of this report , where the Commission examine in great detail the economic definition of regional competitiveness and attempt to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be support , improve and influence by factor which some of you - Mr Markov , just now , and Mrs Raschhofer - stress very forcefully .
I be think of technological research and development , infrastructure provision and quality , human resource potential , small and medium - sized business and direct investment from abroad .
so much for the quality .
I do not wish to spend time right now , Mr Berend , go into detail regard my opinion of the general point which your House have already endorse .
let I just itemise they : the first point concern the usefulness of the conclusion of this report in draw up the priority of the new regional policy , particularly for the negotiation of programming document with the Member States .
secondly , partnership , a subject which a number of you stress , the role of local and regional authority , the private sector , both side of industry , association and local community action group .
regard this problem of partnership , I shall be extremely attentive to ensure that the term of the Structural Funds regulation be apply properly .
thirdly , the need to develop the employment side of growth , even though I be aware , as Mr van Dam just say , that the prime responsibility be that of the Member States , and that , when we speak of the responsibility of Member States , and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy , we must clearly establish what sort of period we be work in .
Mr Fruteau state just now that the fruit of growth be distribute inequitably .
Mr Fruteau , we at least need to recognise that there be growth , and that we be not work in a period of stagnation or recession , as have be the case in the past .
you will tell I that situation of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike .
I agree with your analysis .
when there be growth , it must be well distribute , but a matter that be even more difficult and which more seriously affect the region handicap by their remoteness , be they the most remote or island region , be the lack of growth which generally characterise the last two decade .
fourthly , a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stress just now , the promotion of an equal opportunity policy for woman and young people .
fifthly , the importance and role of small and medium - sized business . Mr Vatanen express this most forcefully just now .
finally , the positive effect on national administration of the system of management of the Structural Funds , the motive of official in manage these fund , even if it be occasionally complicated , and the importance of once again make improvement to the procedure for the evaluation , follow - up and supervision of the Commission .
in relation to this , I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authority on this question of the evaluation of procedure for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds .
I should like to mention a few specific point .
Mr Berend , you express a wish that zoning should be implement quickly .
well , we be come to an end of the zone phase .
tomorrow , the Commission be to decide on the matter for four more country and very soon , I hope , it will be Italy ' s turn .
you may therefore be satisfied on this point , since zoning will have be complete for all the country affect by objective 2 .
regard the informal economy you mention in your report , I be well aware that the analysis and production of statistic on this subject be dependent on the reliability of datum and , as Mr Cocilovo mention , there be clearly a problem with the reliability of this datum .
to a certain extent , they be take into account in the statistic on GDP and labour force survey and , in any case , I wish to point out the effort which Eurostat be make and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistic .
Mr Berend , you also mention , as do Mr Aparicio Sánchez , the lack of reform in the fishery sector .
on this point which be of personal interest to I , let I remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this do not necessarily mean that it be an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of region do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context .
this type of sectoral analysis pertain rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries , under Commissioner Fischler .
nonetheless , I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which , no doubt , will respond well to these concern .
several of you mention point which must be include in the second report on cohesion , and your rapporteur mention some of these .
I wish to assure you , firstly , that the merging of the periodic report and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regard the content of the report on cohesion which be , as far as I be concern , Mr Berend , an extremely important instrument , not only to provide information on what have be achieve in a transparent and rigorous manner , so that future guideline may be examine or evaluate , but also to create a public debate involve the citizen of Europe and , furthermore , with the elect representative , i.e. yourself , on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a european regional planning policy .
in any event , I have take note of your wish to see the follow point include in the report : the definition , compilation and analysis of representative indicator for the region and for all the country of Central and Eastern Europe ; a chapter on the island and most remote region which several of you mention , particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau ; analysis on the competitiveness of the region in the country of Central and Eastern Europe .
this will constitute a great challenge to we all , for you and for the Commission , in the next few year . and finally , there be the cross - border aspect .
I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendation on all these point .
finally , I should like to mention a few political conclusion which you be , in any case , familiar with , but whose main element I should like to reiterate .
lady and gentleman , considerable progress have be make on the road to real convergence , particularly for the four cohesion country , but also frankly , Mr Pohjamo , for the objective 2 region which have suffer some delay in term of development , especially regard infrastructure .
this be my first point regard the policy .
my second point regard the policy be as follow : the Structural Funds have make , and continue to make , a significant contribution to the convergence process .
all the macroeconomic model we be work on show that , over the last decade , more than one third of the convergence achieve in the region whose development be lag behind would not have take place without the Structural Funds .
I have , however , take note , particularly with regard to the most remote region , Mrs Sudre , Mr Fruteau , and Mr Nogueira Román too , that your observation be that there be still much to do - and this be my third point regard the policy - in term of improve employment take - up aspect , the fight against social exclusion , which be particularly serious and intolerable in many of our region , and the integration of woman and young people into the labour market .
now to my fourth point regard the policy ; enlargement of the Union , the great political and humanist project of the come year for our institution , the major challenge , too , for the european policy on cohesion , a point which Mr van Dam highlight .
I shall say that something be already take shape in Berlin and in the financial instrument available to we which may be a policy on cohesion for the first country who be go to join we .
I be think in particular of the pre - accession structural instrument , which I shall be responsible for implement in the next few week .
you see , lady and gentleman , we have only just initiate the new programming and we be already consider together the impact of the Union ' s enlargement on our structural policy .
this sixth periodic report which you assess as positive on the whole , Mr Berend , be a good basis for our thinking , for we all and for myself .
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we be already engage in with regard to the forthcoming guideline , as well as for the proper application of the guideline for the period 2000 - 2006 .
thank you very much , Commissioner .
the debate be close .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( the sitting be close at 8.25 p.m. )
adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
the Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have be distribute .
be there any comment ?
Mr President , I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter refer to in the Minutes .
I refer to item 11 on the order of business .
firstly , I believe the issue raise by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five - year strategic programme be sufficiently important for other speaker who wish to comment briefly on that matter to have be accommodate .
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagree and vote against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group .
the second point I would like to make - and which I would have wish to make yesterday before the vote - be that this Parliament , as other speaker remark yesterday , can only really have an effect if it work in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission .
we should also have the humility to recognise that , if we want to have a strategic debate accompany not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission , but also by a five - year programme , we should have the mechanism in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House , so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wish be .
there be one basic lesson I would like we to learn from this .
when there be major set - piece debate schedule between this House and the European Commission in the future , we should clear all of our line on what be our mutual expectation at least one full working month in advance .
there need firstly to be clarity between all of the group of this House and then between this House and the Commission .
we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution create an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationship .
look at some of the press report of last Friday , I believe that the Commission and its President exercise commendable self - restraint in the way they comment publicly .
that be something for which I have a deep appreciation .
I hope that we will learn the lesson and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe be found on a misapprehension as to what be expect rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institution .
it should not be dramatise into something more than that .
thank you very much , Mr Cox .
I understand what you be say .
we have take note of this .
Mr President , concern item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business , we agree yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today 's agenda .
however , it be withdraw from the Committee on Budgets last night without be discuss or vote on .
it therefore need to be withdraw from today 's agenda .
Mr Wynn , that make sense .
the report be hereby withdraw from the agenda .
Mr President , regard Mrs Lynne 's comment yesterday about health and safety in this building , I presume she be talk about the drain because there be a dreadful smell of drain on the fifth floor in the Tower .
this need to be look into because it be clearly an indication that something be seriously wrong .
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly , but this be a serious problem .
Mrs Ahern , we have take note of this .
I would ask you to bring this specific case , which have to do with the ventilator on a particular floor , to the attention of the Quaestors , who be , in fact , responsible for the matter .
we will also pass this on to our service , however .
thank you very much .
( the Minutes be approve )
reform of european competition policy
the next item be the joint debate on the follow report :
A5 - 0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rule implement Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [ com(1999 ) 101 - C5 - 0105/1999 - 1999/2108(cos ) ] ;
A5 - 0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the European Commission ' s xxviiith Report on Competition Policy 1998 [ sek(1999 ) 743 - C5 - 0121/1999 - 1999/2124(cos ) ] ;
A5 - 0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sector . [ com(1999 ) 148 - C5 - 0107/1999 - 1999/2110(cos ) ] ( Report 1995 - 1997 ) ;
A5 - 0073/1999 by Mr Langen , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision no . 2496/96 / ECSC of 18 December 1996 establish Community rule for state aid to the steel industry ( steel aid Code ) . [ com(1999 ) 94 - C5 - 0104/1999 - 1999/2107(cos ) ] .
Mr President , Commissioner , today we be engage in an important debate about the European Union ' s competition policy .
we be debate a highly controversial modernisation proposal for european monopoly law , that be Mr von Wogau ' s report , and it be far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have give we reason to believe .
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission ' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remain to be see as to whether we be truly justify in use the term " modernisation " to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper , or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression " retrograde step " .
however , we be also discuss the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate relate to the latter .
but , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper .
it be all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the european competition policy .
on read both Commission document , one learn that 1998 be the year in which the modernisation proposal introduce in 1997 be pursue and even partially complete , which be something our own ongoing parliamentary work have teach we .
allow I to make two fundamental comment at this juncture . as the competent authority , the Commission , with its logically consistent approach , have again and again serve the cause of freedom of competition , not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprise concern .
it should continue along this path .
but , Commissioner , none of this be to become less complicated in future - one only have to think of the challenge pose by the enlargement of the Union , the deepening of the internal market , technological progress , globalisation .
indeed , it be not just about modernisation of Community law , more than anything it be about transparency of decision take in individual case , about the possibility of decision actually be able to implement decision , for the european competition policy will be dependent on the population ' s acceptance , together with that of the political body and enterprise concern .
only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .
the competition report 1998 be not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there be nothing that could not be far improve upon .
our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , Commissioner , but there be one point that I would just like to go into now . transparency and accountability belong together .
I do not wish to call the distribution of competence between the Commission and Parliament into question .
the Commission be the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role , for the sake of its own independence ; but Parliament be a supervisory body , and what well forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one ' s decision than a democratically - elect Parliament , indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion ?
here too we should continue along the path we have choose , strengthen and intensify it .
there be one thing I would like to make quite clear though . Parliament be a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matter of competition law , of all thing , be truly scandalous .
therefore , I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful case , even give the Treaty status quo .
I also expect the Commission to be pro - active in support we in our call for codecision in legislative procedure .
this will be a good test as to whether there be reasonable cooperation between the two institution .
with all due respect for the principle of competition , competition be not , however , an end in itself .
competition be an instrument and do not always produce ideal solution .
at the end of the day , one of the fundamental tenet of economic theory be that the market be fail in many respect and anyone who take issue with this be nothing more than an ideologue .
competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resource and fact .
but optimum efficiency do not necessarily come about of its own accord .
framework condition be indispensable when it come to prevent abuse , monopoly law be one example .
but on the whole , this only serve to prevent abuse ; framework condition alone can not achieve socially legitimate goal in isolation .
competition yes , restriction in state aid where necessary and where possible .
however , since state aid form the lion ' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like , regardless of Mr Jonckheer ' s report , to say one more thing about it . it be certainly possible , indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be give to small and medium - sized enterprise involve in research and development for the purpose of educate they in regional and environmental policy .
indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provide for such purpose , provide it do not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition .
this be precisely the area where it be even more important than it be in monopoly and merger law for decision to be comprehensible .
it be not just that we should pillory state aid ; rather our approach must be one of draw distinction and we must assess the different type of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above - mention objective .
my last comment be intend not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People ' s Party .
Mr President , Commissioner , lady and gentleman , the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today be an opinion on the Commission ' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community be authorise under Articles 87 , 88 and 89 of the Treaties .
the Commission report be essentially a descriptive report detail the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sector , accord to various typology , such as the method of financing and the objective pursue .
let I refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspect of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid , on average , for the period under review , be in the order of EUR 95 billion , correspond to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993 - 1995 , a reduction which be essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany .
to put it plainly , the level of state aid declare , roughly speak , be generally stable during the period under discussion and come to approximately 1.2 % of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent , coincidentally , of the Community budget for one year .
this be the case , there be considerable disparity between state , which may be measure in various way , such as , for example , as a percentage of add value and per wage earner .
I think it be also interesting to add state aid and Community aid , which may be assimilate in some way into state aid .
this clearly show that it be the four country which benefit from the Cohesion Fund , among other thing , which come at the top of the list .
this be the case , let I now come to the proposal make in the report .
we note , first of all , that the committee consider the datum , as present in the Commission ' s annual report , to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in - depth evaluation of state aid policy which be simultaneously legitimate , sensitive to national interest and extensive in term of compliance with the rule of competition , pursuant to the actual term of the Treaty .
the Commission can only collate and analyse the datum provide by the Member States .
it be therefore down to the state and region to ensure the quality of the datum provide , and our committee consider that additional effort must be make in this respect .
it be in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example , have champion the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid , accessible via the internet .
have well , more detailed information available , particularly with regard to the objective pursue and the result record , must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner study of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policy .
and insofar as such study already exist , to publish more openly its own comment with regard to the objective of the treaty , which be not only to ensure the competitivity of the european economy , but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion .
by stress , primarily , the quality of the information provide , our debate in committee , and hence the report which it be my honour to present to you , avoid a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid be , in absolute term , either too high or not high enough .
Most committee member have seek rather to find a balance between , on the one hand , the need to see that both state and business comply with the competition rule and , on the other hand , acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contribute to the objective of the Treaty , particularly , as I have say already , as regard sustainable development , research and development and economic and social cohesion .
this be the case , various amendment to the rapporteur ' s initial draft report be adopt in committee , particularly highlight the need for effective reimbursement of aid find to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of result .
seven amendment have be retable for this plenary sitting .
Most of they be an expression of the political difference among ourselves regard the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid , in view of the inadequacy , acknowledge or not , of private investment alone , the market failure or inadequacy of the market .
there be in particular one amendment , let I point out , concern the energy sector , which , in my capacity as rapporteur , I see as particularly important .
I should like to conclude this presentation , Commissioner , by stress two thing : firstly , a concern of the member of the committee and , secondly , a demand of our committee .
the concern involve the pre - accession process for the country of Central and Eastern Europe , in term of competition policy and state aid .
this be undoubtedly a complex issue , and one where we should like to see the Commission inform we of the late development in the matter , particularly in term of the capacity of the economy involve in the accession process to comply with competition rule and , as far as state aid be concern , the need , in all probability , to have specific rule on state aid use to assist restructuring of their sector .
and finally , in conclusion , our demand regard the future responsibility of the European Parliament in the matter we be discuss , competition policy and state aid , in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference .
as you know , Commissioner , our report argue that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid .
Mr President , Commissioner , my contribution to today ' s debate concern the steel aid code , that be the state aid in Europe grant in accordance with this code and which be assess by the Commission .
there be a total of 27 case in 1998 and the Commission submit its own report on these .
the ECSC Treaty be due to expire shortly .
hence , what we must focus on today be the question as to how state aid be to be manage in future .
the European Commission ' s decision , which feature in the report , be welcome by the European Parliament , as be the decision to ask for the money back in specific case , thus apply Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty .
the competitiveness of the european steel industry also form the subject of the Commission ' s most recent communication , which we have not yet debate in Parliament .
as in other sector , the general ban on state aid accord to Article 87 ( 1 ) of the EC Treaty also apply to the iron and steel industry .
accord to this article , state aid be irreconcilable with the common market , in principle .
exemption be only permit in precisely define case .
under Article 88 , the Commission be oblige to supervise state aid .
in 1998 , the large case concern the supply of company capital total EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany .
furthermore , the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intention concern state aid .
the rule pertain to the steel industry be draw up on 18 December 1996 .
these stipulate that state aid can only be award to the steel industry in particular , precisely - define case i.e. those involve aid for research and development , aid for environmental protection , social security to ease the closure of steelwork and aid to help non - competitive enterprise cease trade altogether .
in addition , there be a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece .
however , there be obviously problem with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few year that be not bring fully to bear in the report .
as far as Parliament be concern , it be important for we to waste no time in get down to a debate on the regulation that be to succeed this state aid code once it have expire .
there must be no watering - down of the exist principle underlie the steel aid code .
no one want an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe .
this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry have undergo consolidation in the past few year .
consequently , Parliament believe it be necessary for the steel aid code to be amend in the light of the industry ' s claim about unequal treatment , and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow - up regulation .
we all know that so far the Council have drag its foot with regard to follow - up regulation of this kind .
the reason for this be that people be under the impression that once the steel aid code expire , they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission ' s supervision .
we therefore demand that once the Treaty expire , steel aid must be regulate by a Council regulation accord to Article 94 , for that be the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity .
this be the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not cover by the code .
a Council regulation that be directly applicable law must also be observe by the regional government .
what we need to avoid do in the future be compromise competition condition and disturb the balance in the market .
we also need to criticise the Commission ' s practice of approve multiple aid package for steel enterprise which in their view , do not fall within the category of the code , even give the fact that the European Court of Justice approve this unequal treatment where certain individual decision be concern .
the Commission will be call upon , in a report that have yet to be compile for the year 1999 , to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructure plan and approve exemption , thus enable a proper assessment of the overall situation to be make .
once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have adopt the draft report unanimously with two abstention , I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity , which we have ourselves create , in plenary sitting .
Mr President , lady and gentleman , the internal market be not complete .
subsidy , monopoly and barrier to competition be still impede market and development alike .
national government provide subsidy and promise that this be the last time , but then it happen again .
subsidy distort allocation , both within and between country .
a successive phasing out of state aid be require , and more and more market must be open up to competition .
this apply to those which have be turn into monopoly , both private and public .
public monopoly be , more often than not , phase out reluctantly .
increase competition and newly establish organisation should be able to provide significant benefit in term of welfare , include within the sphere of education , health care and social service .
public monopoly must be replace by competitive structure .
Europe must be modernise , make more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapt in such a way that it become a more competitive environment for consumer and company .
effective competition push price down and raise standard of live .
it be precisely upon price level that consumer policy have fail to focus sufficiently .
in fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .
the internal market be the basis for our work .
its legislation be to apply equally to all , to large and small country alike .
a systematic survey of the various national regulation be need if barrier to competition be to be dismantle .
the EU ' s own regulation too may therefore need to be analyse .
the new model now be test by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the establish competition policy .
in order to be effective , it must be well anchor in the Member States ' national authority .
in six month ' time , it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation ' s effect upon the Commission ' s role .
the question of how good to make further progress have so far be solve through the idea of hold an inter - institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopt a broad perspective and involve representative of different interest .
this will provide the opportunity to establish new principle or to return to the more radical change which have be discuss .
there will also be the opportunity to find new common solution and to analyse amendment from the committee debate .
the law must be correctly apply in matter of competition .
wrongly apply competition policy may cause loss in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership , which be an important and basic principle we should stand up for .
we have a quite exciting debate in front of we .
a conference where the issue be properly debate will make it possible to straighten out misunderstanding , at the same time as perhaps improve upon certain point .
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their effort to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunity and new resource for our citizen .
in fact , in my own constituency of Stockholm , we have many good local example of increase supply and improve quality which have arise precisely because of exposure to competition in area which be previously total monopoly .
we would encourage a continuation of the open debate which have be strengthen in the course of consideration of the report by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay .
we hope that the legal point of view will also be accord the importance which be only reasonable in a state base on the rule of law .
Mr President , as a new Member I be pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today , even though there have be a delay .
I would like to begin by thank the rapporteur Mr von Wogau , Mr Langen , Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer , as well as the Commission , for their excellent cooperation .
competition be certainly fundamental to the social market economy and european competition policy be a success story ; take the energy and telecommunications sector , where there have be a demonstrable lowering of price and improvement in quality of service .
all this be to the good of the consumer .
but we have now arrive at a point where we need to develop competition policy far .
the Commission have put forward a new White Paper on this contain two key point : drop the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
drop the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration cost , at any rate .
at the same time , this change of system will also lead to more onus be place on the individual in the business world , of course .
it will no long simply be a case of submit paper and have they approve ; for one thing , each person will have to take responsibility themselves , and that be probably why there be unease about this in other quarter .
however I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape .
the second point relate to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
if we be to create a culture of law in Europe , then there be no doubt that the law must be apply not only by the Commission , by central body , but also by national authority , by national court .
we be not discuss the fact that although every EU law be only ever decide on centrally , it be precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty .
it will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprise to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter .
the way to a european monopoly commission must be keep clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we be to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid be be grant , then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined .
however , when it come to what the future hold for competition , there be two issue dear to my heart .
one be subsidiarity .
we all hold the view that competition be vital to the economy and require there to be efficiency , and I believe we should also permit competition in the region .
competition between the region will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union .
I would cite , by way of example , the issue of job creation scheme , saving bank and regional bank , and Gütesiegel .
here , a region have , by its own effort , create a means of market its own product .
this own initiative must not be destroy by european intervention .
I believe there be also a need to raise the de minimis regulation .
we should do everything within our power to force the region into a situation where they have to compete with each other .
my second point relate to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although I be not go to talk about market failure just now .
I have already refer to the regional and saving bank sector , but I would just like to focus on a matter one hear again and again in certain quarter .
these day , someone who live in an old people ' s home be accommodate within the social field .
however , I could also regard they as a customer , and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the way in which the social field , that is evolve structure , stifle competition .
apart from that , I could refer to any customer , any sector , as customer , and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social field .
to conclude , I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity . I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow region and local authority to raise taxis , they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the - board regulation by Europe .
thank you very much , Mr Radwan .
I would like to congratulate you on what be refer to in german parliamentary - speak , inappropriately in your case , as a maiden speech .
Mr President , Commissioner , I be speak on behalf of my fellow Member , Robert Goebbels , who be unable to attend due to a political commitment .
within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , the Jonckheer report have give rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market .
a slim right - wing majority succeed in remove any reference to market failure .
even if the majority in this House be to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the real world .
economic relationship in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminate all public intervention in the market do not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resource .
while , since the dawn of time , the market have be the key forum for human interchange , it have never be perfect .
the market favour the short term and immediate profit .
on the market , the balance of power between supply and demand be generally to the detriment of the weak party , consumer and worker .
in order to function , the market need rule .
the necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society .
we european Socialists be in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .
the market be not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .
the European Union or individual state must not take over from economic operator , but public authority must define the rule and objective which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion .
finally , aid can enable restructuring , offer training , save job and thus know - how .
the main objective of the Union ' s competition policy can not be to reduce the overall level of aid .
this aid must be align with the objective of the Union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .
the Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinder the internal market .
